    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.[4] Croissants have long
      been a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries.
      The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century. In the late
      1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but unbaked
      dough made them into a fast food that can be freshly baked by unskilled
      labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a
      French response to American-style fast food,[5] and as of 2008, 30–40% of
      the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from
      frozen dough.
